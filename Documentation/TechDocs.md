         - Implements the logic required to retrieve the payment details from the cosmos database.

   - **Behaviors**:
     - `LoggingBehavior.cs`: Implements logging behavior for all requests.
     - `ValidationBehavior.cs`: Implements validation behavior for all requests.
   - **Dependency Injection**:
     - `DependencyInjection.cs`: Handles the registration of services and dependencies in the IoC container.

### 3. **Headless Service**
   - **Queues**:
     - **PaymentGateway.PaymentService**:
       - **EventProcessor**:
         - `EventHubSimulatorProcessor.cs`: Handles events from the simulated Event Hub and logs out message that would have been sent through http.
         - `PaymentEvent.cs`: Represents the event structure used in payment processing with events.
       - **PaymentProcessor**:
         - `CreatePaymentProcessor.cs`: Creates a new payment request, updates the status to `PROCESSING` and sends to next queue and event queue.
         - `PaymentGatewayHandlerService.cs`: Main handler to receives all incoming queue messages that relates to payments.
         - `ProcessPaymentsHandler.cs`: Manages the payment processing from `PROCESSING` to `DECLINED` or `AUTHORIZED`.
       - **Services**:
         - `PaymentQueueService.cs`: Sends queue messages for payments.
         - `EventHubSimulatorService.cs`: Send queue messages for events.

### 4. **PaymentGateway.Bank.Simulator**
   - **Purpose**: A simulator for bank interactions, which helps in testing the payment processing pipeline without needing access to real banking APIs.
   - **Processors**:
     - `BankSimulatorProcessor.cs`: Handles simulated bank interactions, such as authorizing payments and checking account balances.

### 5. **PaymentGateway.Common**
   - **Purpose**: Contains common utilities, extensions, and shared logic used across different projects in the solution.
